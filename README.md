LightFM-Based Hybrid Recommendation System for Telecom Operators

This project implements a hybrid recommendation system using the LightFM library, designed for telecommunication operators to optimize mobile plan assignment for customers.

The system leverages both content-based and collaborative filtering techniques to recommend the most suitable plans to users, based on:

Individual usage behavior (calls, data, SMS, etc.)

Similarity with other users’ profiles and preferences

🔍 Key Features:

Hybrid recommendation model (Collaborative + Content-based)

Built using LightFM for efficient model training and evaluation

Data preprocessing and feature engineering for telecom usage data

Evaluation metrics: precision@k, recall@k

Scalable design for academic and enterprise applications

🎯 Objective:
Facilitate personalized plan assignment and enhance customer satisfaction through intelligent, data-driven recommendations.

🧠 Technologies Used:

Python

LightFM

NumPy, Pandas, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib / Seaborn (for data visualization)

📚 Use Case:
Academic project demonstrating the application of machine learning in telecom personalization through a hybrid recommendation approach.
